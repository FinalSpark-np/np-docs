    "# Recording live data\n",
    "\n",
    "This code allows you to record live data from the [FinalSpark LiveMEA webview](https://livemea.finalspark.com/live) and save it to an HDF5 file.<br>\n",
    "It provides both an API and a CLI for ease of use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is available [at the following link](https://github.com/FinalSpark-np/LiveMEA).\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "The code is usable even if you are not a NeuroPlatform user, and is freely available for anyone to use.<br>\n",
    "Please reuse the provided code in your own projects and modify it as needed; the current implementation merely provides a simple way to record data from the live view.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data specification\n",
    "\n",
    "The live view gives, roughly every second, 4096 samples of data from 32 electrodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, each \"duration\" unit corresponds to 4096 values; the sampling frequency is 30kHz downsampled via wavelet transform by a factor of 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Therefore, a duration of 1 corresponds in reality to ~1.09 seconds of data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Expect a **disk usage of around 1.04 MB**, and an **average wait time of 1.09 seconds per second of recording**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend using a virtual environment or a conda environment to install the required packages.\n",
    "For anyone unfamiliar with or new to Python, we recommend installing [miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/) to create a new environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clone the repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```sh\n",
    "    git clone https://github.com/FinalSpark-np/LiveMEA.git\n",
    "    cd live-mea\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "````{margin}\n",
    "```{hint}\n",
    "To use the libraries you installed, you will have to activate the environment each time you open a new terminal.\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create and activate a conda environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```sh\n",
    "    conda create --name livemea-env python=3.11\n",
    "    conda activate livemea-env\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Install the required packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```sh\n",
    "    pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## API Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "```{caution}\n",
    "Using the `record()` method in Datalore/Jupyter will not work.\n",
    "You will have to use `await record_async()` instead.\n",
    "See the [Example](utils:livemea-record-example) below for more details.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### LiveMEA Class\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from MEA_live import LiveMEA\n",
    "from pathlib import Path\n",
    "\n",
    "live_mea = LiveMEA(save_path: str | Path, recording_duration: int = 5, mea_id: int = 1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `save_path`\n",
    "  (str | Path): Path to save the HDF5 file.\n",
    "- `recording_duration`\n",
    " (int, optional): Duration of recording in \"seconds\" (chunks of 4096 samples).<br>Defaults to 5.\n",
    "- `mea_id`\n",
    "  (int, optional): MEA ID to use. Defaults to 1, must be between 1 and 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "````{margin}\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "The data is saved to the h5 automatically after the recording is complete.\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "- `record()` : Starts recording live data and saves it to the specified HDF5 file.\n",
    "- `record_async()` : Starts recording live data asynchronously and saves it to the specified HDF5 file. Used within Datalore/Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "- `plot_data(h5f_path: str | Path)`: Plots data from an HDF5 file. Requires Matplotlib as an additional dependency.\n",

    "- `-d`, `--duration` (int, optional): Duration of the recording in seconds. Defaults to 5.\n",
    "- `-p`, `--path` (str, optional): Path to save the recorded data. Defaults to \"live_data.h5\".\n",
    "- `-m`, `--MEA` (int, optional): MEA ID to record data from. Defaults to 1.\n",

    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "python live-mea -d 10 -p \"live_data.h5\" -m 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will record live MEA data for 10 seconds and save it to `live_data.h5` using MEA 1.\n",
    "\n",

    "The CLI works both in DataLore and Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "Simply use `!` before the command within your notebook cell.\n",

    "## Accessing the saved data\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time point is saved under its own group in the HDF5 file. The data for each electrode is then saved as a dataset within the group.\n",
    "\n",
