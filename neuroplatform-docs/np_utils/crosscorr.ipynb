    "# Cross-correlograms\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-correlograms (cross-correlation histograms) are used to analyze the temporal relationships between two sets of event times. \n",
    "\n",
    "They are particularly useful for analyzing neural spike data and understanding the interactions between different channels; such as the synchronization of neural activity between different neurons, or complex patterns of co-activation between different sites, such as oscillatory activity.\n",
    "\n",

    "name: cross_corr\n",

    "An example of a cross-correlogram. The x-axis represents the time difference between the two events, and the y-axis represents the normalized number of events in each bin (probability density function).\n",

    "For further examples and characterizations of this tool, please see [Tsubo & Shinimoto, 2023](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.12.544700v1).\n",

    "## Creating a cross-correlogram and parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "To start computing cross-correlograms, initialize the CrossCorrelogram class with the desired time window and bin size.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The time window is the duration of the cross-correlogram in milliseconds\n",
    "- The bin size is the width of each bin in milliseconds. \n",
    "- Optionally, you can set the normalize parameter to True to normalize the cross-correlogram by the square root of the product of the number of events in each dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "While bin sizes ten times smaller than $\\Delta t$ are recommended, the most critical aspect in capturing the temporal structure of the data is the time window $\\Delta t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure to use a $\\Delta t$ that corresponds to the time scale of the phenomena you are interested in.\n",
    "- Be careful when including stimulation in the analysis, as it can introduce artifacts in the cross-correlogram.\n",
    "- The recommended amount of data varies depending on the activity of the electrode and the phenomena you are interested in, but is generally minutes or hours.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    "You may also compute auto-correlograms by passing the same dataframe to both the `df1` and `df2` parameters.\n",
    "When doing this, use the `hide_center_bin` parameter to hide the central bin, which might otherwise hinder the readability of the cross-correlogram.\n",
