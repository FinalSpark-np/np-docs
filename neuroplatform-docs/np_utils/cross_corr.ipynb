    "# Computing Cross-Correlograms\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-correlograms (cross-correlation histograms) are used to analyze the temporal relationships between two sets of event times. They are particularly useful for analyzing neural spike data and understanding the interactions between different channels; such as the synchronization of neural activity between different neurons, or complex patterns of co-activation between different sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CrossCorrelogram module provides tools to compute and plot cross-correlograms between two sets of event times.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start computing cross-correlograms, initialize the CrossCorrelogram class with the desired time window and bin size. The time window is the duration of the cross-correlogram in milliseconds, and the bin size is the width of each bin in milliseconds. Optionally, you can set the normalize parameter to True to normalize the cross-correlogram by the square root of the product of the number of events in each dataframe."
