    "  - **Index** : The index of the electrode to stimulate. This is the number of the electrode in the MEA.\n",
    "  - **Trigger** : The trigger is used by the **Trigger Generator** to send a signal to the **Intan Controller** to execute the **StimParam** associated with that trigger. There is a maximum of 16 triggers that can be used, from 0 to 15.\n",
    "    - For example, if you send trigger 1 with two **StimParam**s with `trigger_key = 1` on electrodes (`index`) 0 and 1 respectively, the **Intan Controller** will stimulate electrodes 0 and 1 using the specified parameters when it receives the trigger 0. See the scheme below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{caution}\n",
    "**DO NOT** use the same index in two different **StimParam**s. This will overwrite the previous **StimParam** and only use the last one.\n",

If a StimParam is defined for a given index, whenever the trigger is sent, the Intan Controller will execute the StimParam on the electrode associated with that index.
