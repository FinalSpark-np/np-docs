    "## Common issues FAQ\n",
    "\n",
    "### MEAs, live view and stimulation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are the differences between the MEAs? Does the layout matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have currently two MEA configurations : **4x8** and **1x32**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As there is no cross-talk between sites in the 4x8 configuration, you may parallelize some experiments, which is not possible with the 1x32 configuration (since the sites are too close to each other).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the 1x32 configuration has a higher density of sites, which may be useful for some experiments, and may increase the chances of having a particular combination of sites that may be useful for your experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why is there constant noise on a channel?\n",
    "\n",
    "The organoid may not fully cover or be in contact with the electrode, as they are spherical and may not be perfectly centered.\n",
    "\n",
    " See [below](faq:noise-vs-events) for more information on how to differentiate between noise and activity.\n",
    "<!-- TODO picture -->\n",
    "\n",
    "#### There is not enough signal on the MEA\n",
    "\n",
    "This is likely due to the organoids losing activity over time. Please contact us so that we can change the organoids.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "If you are using a dedicated access, do not lower the event threshold to get \"more activity\", as there may simply not be any activity anymore and you will record noise.\n",
    "```\n",
    "(faq:noise-vs-events)=\n",
    "#### How to differentiate between noise and activity?\n",
    "\n",
    "Stimulation artifacts tend to have an amplitude far greater than the organoid's activity, so checking the amplitude tag of the events may help you determine if there are any artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you may also check the shape of recorded events in the database, to see if they correspond to the expected shape of spikes.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a dedicated access, you may inspect the live waveforms to see if they correspond to the expected shape of spikes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, amplitudes below 30 µV are likely to be noise, while amplitudes above a 1000 µV are likely to be artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a perfectly regular signal, with a nearly constant amplitude, shape and frequency, is likely to be noise or another extraneous signal, unrelated to the organoid. Please contact us if you have any doubts.\n",
    "<!-- TODO pictures -->\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The program went into maintenance mode during my booking\n",
    "\n",
    "Please contact us.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The spike count on an organoid is too high/low\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that \"events\" are recorded in the database, not spikes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since an event is a recording of 3ms whenever the threshold is crossed, the number of events is not directly comparable to the number of spikes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A spiking rate of up to 1500 per minute is still normal, but tenfold more may indicate an issue with the event threshold.\n",
    "Feel free to ask if you have further doubts regarding the activity of a channel. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    "Make sure to reset the variable threshold to True whenever you start or finish an experiment.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### I am unsure about triggers/parameters, and how I can parallelize my experiments or dynamically change parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Please re-read the [system basics](np-core:basics) page. If anything is still unclear, please contact us.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some triggers cause stimulation on several sites/MEAs in an unexpected way\n",
    "\n",
    "Please make sure to disable all parameters at the end of your experiment, as they are not reset automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you suspect there may be leftover triggers from a previous experiment on the shared access, please contact us.\n",
    "- On a dedicated access, please remove any other triggers that may be active.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How long should I wait after a stimulation to start taking events into account and avoid artifacts?\n",
    "\n",
    "Excluding the 10ms after the stimulation is a good rule of thumb, but it may vary depending on the stimulation parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### I am unsure about the stimulation parameters and/or am not sure they are correctly set\n",
    "\n",
    "Our parameter visualization tool may help you understand the parameters you are using; see our [parameter visualization tool](utils:stimparamloader) page.\n",
    "If you are still unsure, please contact us.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Is it possible to perform high-speed closed loops, e.g. modulating stimulation frequency based on the activity of the organoid in real-time?\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you do not change the stimulation parameters, you can technically go as low as 10ms on a dedicated access. \n",
    "- For shared users, the closed-loop reading capabilities will be limited to 200ms\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have to change the stimulation parameters, this will not be possible, but we are currently working on a solution to mitigate this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stimulation does not elicit any response from the organoid\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- - Scan using our -->\n",
    "- Stimulations usually only elicit most of the response on their own channel, so make sure to check the correct channel.\n",
    "- As the organoid gets older, increasing the stimulation amplitude may be necessary.\n",
    "- Neurons require resources to fire, so fatigue may eventually occur after repeated stimulations. Use a higher delay between stimulations (1-10s) to avoid this issue.\n",
    "- If all else is ineffective, please contact us so we can change the organoids.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Database and experiment tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "#### I do not have an Experiment token, or it is no longer valid\n",
    "\n",
    "Please contact us.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### I receive only empty data/plots from the database, even though the same code worked previously\n",
    "\n",
    "On the shared access, there may have been a change of organoids, which requires you to change your experiment token. Please contact us so we can provide you with the updated token.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When starting my experiment, I receive an error about an experiment already running\n",
    "\n",
    "Please double-check the shared access booking to make sure you are not overriding someone else's experiment. If you are sure that you are not, please contact us.\n",
    "Otherwise, use `experiment.stop()` to stop the experiment, and try again.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Neuroplatform utilities\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The LiveMEA recording tool stopped working\n",
    "\n",
    "We may have changed the way we stream data to the website. Please contact us.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### There is an issue with Neuroplatform utilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you use Python 3.11 and have installed all the requirements for the *specific utility you are using*. If you are still having issues, please contact us."
