    "Please write to [Jean-Marc Comby](mailto:jean-marc.comby@finalspark.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common issues FAQ\n",
    "\n",
    "### MEAs, live view and stimulation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### There is not enough signal on the MEA\n",
    "\n",
    "This is likely due to the organoids losing activity over time. Please contact us so that we can change the organoids.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "If you are using a dedicated access, do not lower the event threshold to get \"more activity\", as there may simply not be any activity anymore and you will record noise.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The program went into maintenance mode during my booking\n",
    "\n",
    "Please contact us.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The spike count on an organoid is too high/low\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to ask if you have doubts regarding the activity of a channel. \n",
    "A spiking rate of up to 1500 per minute is normal, but a lot more may indicate an issue with the event threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    "Make sure to reset the variable threshold to True whenever you start or finish an experiment.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### I am unsure about triggers/parameters, and how I can parallelize my experiments or dynamically change parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Please re-read the [system basics](np-core:basics) page. If anything is still unclear, please contact us.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some triggers cause stimulation on several sites/MEAs in an unexpected way\n",
    "\n",
    "Please make sure to disable all parameters at the end of your experiment, as they are not reset automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you suspect there may be leftover triggers from a previous experiment on the shared access, please contact us.\n",
    "- On a dedicated access, please remove any other triggers that may be active.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Database and experiment tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "#### I do not have an Experiment token, or it is no longer valid\n",
    "\n",
    "Please contact us.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### I receive only empty data/plots from the database, even though the same code worked previously\n",
    "\n",
    "On the shared access, there may have been a change of organoids, which requires you to change your experiment token. Please contact us so we can provide you with the updated token.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When starting my experiment, I receive an error about an experiment already running\n",
    "\n",
    "Please double-check the shared access booking to make sure you are not overriding someone else's experiment. If you are sure that you are not, please contact us.\n",
    "Otherwise, use `experiment.stop()` to stop the experiment, and try again."
