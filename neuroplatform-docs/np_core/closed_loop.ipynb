    "# Closed-loop : reading and stimulating\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial details how to use the Intan to read the number of spikes in a way that may be used to perform closed-loop experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept is that if you need to trigger stimulations based on some response of the organoids, you may use these functionalities to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "If you need the activity over periods longer than minutes, you may wish to use the database instead. See the [Database tutorial](db_usage).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The counting will obtain the count for 200ms after the trigger is sent. The count is stored in a buffer for all 128 electrodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using the Intan to read the number of spikes\n",
    "\n",
    "The `IntanSofware` class provides the following methods :\n",
    "\n",
    "- `set_count` : set which triggers start the counting process\n",
    "  - The input should be a list of trigger IDs (from 0 to 15).\n",
    "- Next, you must send the trigger in question to start the counting process.\n",
    "- Finally, `read_count` lets you retrieve the buffer storing the number of spikes.\n",
    "  - The buffer is a 128-length array containing the number of spikes for each electrode. \n",
    "  - Make sure to select the channels relevant to your experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{caution}\n",
    "`read_count` intrinsically does nothing to count the spikes.<br>\n",
    "It only retrieves the buffer storing the number of spikes.<br>\n",
    "You must first send the triggers (using a `Trigger()` object, see [here](core:np-trigger-gen)) that have been set to listen (using `set_count`) to populate the `read_count` buffer.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you set a trigger to read on which there is a StimParam defined, the StimParam will be triggered as well.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you only wish to read, make sure to use a trigger without a StimParam.\n",
    "\n",
