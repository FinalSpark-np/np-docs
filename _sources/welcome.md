# Welcome to the NeuroPlatform documentation!

## Introduction

This documentation will guide through the basics of using FinalSpark's NeuroPlatform.

The first part focuses on basic usage of the platform : stimulating organoids, fetching data from the platform and reading spikes for closed-loop experiments.

The second part lists several utilities that you may find useful in your experiments, whether for setting up your parameters or empowering your data analysis.

```{hint}
**Every tutorial page can be downloaded as a Jupyter notebook.**

Click on the *"Download as .ipynb"* button at the top right of the page.
This will allow you to test the sample code on your provided machine.
