    "  - A **spike event** is logged whenever the voltage from an electrode crosses a threshold of six times the standard deviation of the noise.\n",
    "  - For an in-depth tutorial on using the database, see the [Database tutorial](db_usage).\n",
    "- **Intan Software** : This software is connected to the MEAs and is used to configure the system and to acquire data. You will be interacting with this software via Python to control the system.\n",
    "- **Intan Controller** : The hardware in charge of recording and stimulating the electrodes. This is the physical device that is connected to the MEAs.\n",

    "  - When you set a **StimParam** in Python, it will be sent to the Intan software. \n",

    "- The StimParam is associated with a trigger. Whenever said trigger is sent, the **Intan Controller** will execute the **StimParam** associated with that trigger, on the electrode to which the **StimParam** is associated.\n",
    "  - **Index** : The index of the electrode to stimulate. This is the number of the electrode in the MEA.\n",
    "  - **Trigger** : The trigger is used by the **Trigger Generator** to send a signal to the **Intan Controller** to execute the **StimParam**. There is a maximum of 16 triggers that can be used, from 0 to 15.\n",
    "    - For example, if you send trigger 0 with two **StimParam**s with `trigger_key = 0` on electrodes (`index`) 1 and 2 respectively, the **Intan Controller** will stimulate electrodes 1 and 2 using the specified parameters when it receives the trigger 0.\n",
